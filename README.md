# Ethical_AI_Simulator
Developed an interactive AI simulator that models ethical decisions in real-life scenarios (e.g., autonomous vehicles). It uses rule-based logic to evaluate user-inputted dilemmas and provides clear, human-readable explanations. Designed with a web interface to promote understanding of AI ethics, safety, and transparency.
